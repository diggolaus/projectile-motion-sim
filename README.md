# About the Projectile Motion Simulator 
This projectile motion simulator was a project a friend and I developed for our Analytical Physics class. It is meant to be an interactive calculator with a visual aid. 

# To download
The files I have here require Unity software to function. I have only included unique files in this respository, and the application can be replicated by downloading all files and pasting them into an existing, fresh Unity project.

# Use instructions

### Manipulating Variables:
B - This will reset the position of the projectile at any time.


W - This will increase the Mass of the projectile.

S - This will decrease the Mass.

Up Arrow - This increases the Force used to send the projectile in motion, which also will increase the Launch Velocity variable.

Down Arrow - The same, but will decrease the Force and decrease the Launch Velocity.


X - This will move the starting block up, increasing the Initial Height variable.

Z - The same, but will move the block down and decrease Initial Height.


Mouse Click - Aim and click on the screen the direction you intend to launch the projectile. This will change the Angle variable.

### Beginning Calculation:

Return/Enter - to launch the projectile.

Once the projectile has landed, perform the calculations:

R - Calculates the total horizontal range the projectile travelled

T - Calculates the total time the projectile was in the air, up until it hits the ground (or where the ground would be, if the projectile happens to overshoot)

H - Calculates the maximum height the projectile reached during flight
